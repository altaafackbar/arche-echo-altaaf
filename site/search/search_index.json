The intent of the application is to fully integrate parents when it comes to the healthcare of their children by providing them with knowledge translation(KT) tools which combine the best available scientific evidence with the past experiences of parents in an engaging and informative format.The approach allows parents to feel more involved in the health of their families and feel a heightened degree of confidence when making choices involving the health of their children. The target users of the application will be Albertan parents who are both English and French speaking. There will also be administrative users with experience in the medical field who will be tasked with managing and updating the resources that the parents will be accessing. The product will be used as a mobile application for both iOS and Android.

Language Toggle functionality - This functionality allows the user to switch between English and Spanish by simply pressing a toggle button. This is a feature that our client has requested for our project albeit with French instead of Spanish, so this feature can be drawn upon as inspiration to determine the best way to integrate the language toggle. 9-1-1 Call Integration functionality - This feature allows the user to call 9-1-1 directly through the application which is also a feature that our client has requested be included in our project. Since we need this exact feature, the means in which the American Red Cross implemented this feature can be drawn upon for inspiration. KidsDoc App administered by the American Academy of Pediatrics that helps parents determine the degree of care their children may require based on their symptoms. Symptom Checker functionality - Very similar functionality to what we are planning to implement with the Symptom Checker. Allows users to click on the body part of a child body model to see symptoms associated with that body part. This functionality will be partially used as inspiration as to the style in which we should implement the symptom checker into the application. \u2018Immediate Connections\u2019 functionality - This is similar in premise to a client requested feature where the user is able to quickly access a phone call to 911 or call nearby Emergency Departments. This feature can be used as inspiration since the client\u2019s requested feature follows the same general premise with a slight variation in the approach. \u2018Home Care Advice\u2019 functionality - This is similar to the Knowledge Translation(KT) tools integrated into the client app where the parent is able to access clear and up-to-date information and resources for the parents to treat their children\u2019s symptoms from home. Open Source Products React Native Translation Open source library for implementing other languages in React Native. Allows the user to toggle between different languages seamlessly. Using this library would be an efficient means of integrating French and English translation options in the app. Geolocator API API used to access geolocation of device and pinpoint exact location. Finds the location of the user which we can subsequently use along with the Google Maps SDK to find nearby clinics based on user location. Google Maps SDK Software Development Kit for integrating Google Maps into applications. Implements Google Maps into the application which can be used to pinpoint nearby clinics for users to find based on their geographic location.

This is a feature that our client has requested for our project albeit with French instead of Spanish, so this feature can be drawn upon as inspiration to determine the best way to integrate the language toggle. 9-1-1 Call Integration functionality - This feature allows the user to call 9-1-1 directly through the application which is also a feature that our client has requested be included in our project. Since we need this exact feature, the means in which the American Red Cross implemented this feature can be drawn upon for inspiration. KidsDoc App administered by the American Academy of Pediatrics that helps parents determine the degree of care their children may require based on their symptoms. Symptom Checker functionality - Very similar functionality to what we are planning to implement with the Symptom Checker. Allows users to click on the body part of a child body model to see symptoms associated with that body part. This functionality will be partially used as inspiration as to the style in which we should implement the symptom checker into the application. \u2018Immediate Connections\u2019 functionality - This is similar in premise to a client requested feature where the user is able to quickly access a phone call to 911 or call nearby Emergency Departments. This feature can be used as inspiration since the client\u2019s requested feature follows the same general premise with a slight variation in the approach. \u2018Home Care Advice\u2019 functionality - This is similar to the Knowledge Translation(KT) tools integrated into the client app where the parent is able to access clear and up-to-date information and resources for the parents to treat their children\u2019s symptoms from home.","title":"Similar Products"},{"location":"requirements/#open-source-products","text":"React Native Translation Open source library for implementing other languages in React Native.
