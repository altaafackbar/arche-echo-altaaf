<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARCHE and ECHO research programs are focused on improving health outcomes for children by developing arts-based health resources for parents and families about common childhood conditions. The intent of the application is to fully integrate parents when it comes to the healthcare of their children by providing them with knowledge translation(KT) tools which combine the best available scientific evidence with the past experiences of parents in an engaging and informative format.The approach allows parents to feel more involved in the health of their families and feel a heightened degree of confidence when making choices involving the health of their children. The target users of the application will be Albertan parents who are both English and French speaking. There will also be administrative users with experience in the medical field who will be tasked with managing and updating the resources that the parents will be accessing. The product will be used as a mobile application for both iOS and Android. Parents will be able to login to the app and gain access to the various KT tools in formats such as interactive infographics, videos, and eBooks while also providing functionalities such as access to nearby Emergency Departments and access to wait times for selected clinics.</p>
<h2 id="project-glossary">Project Glossary</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Admin</strong> - Admin is a user with administrative access to the app. This user has a medical background where they will be responsible for updating and managing resources for the target users. They will also have the ability to edit user accounts and access data analytics based on usage by the users.</li>
<li><strong>ARCHE</strong> - ARCHE is an acronym for Alberta Research Centre for Health Evidence which is administered by PI Dr. Lisa Hartling from the Department of Pediatrics.</li>
<li><strong>ECHO</strong> - ECHO is an acronym for translating Evidence in Child Health to enhance Outcomes which is administered by PI Dr. Shannon Scott from the Faculty of Nursing.</li>
<li><strong>KT Tools</strong> - KT tools refers to Knowledge Translation tools which are various evidence based tools that combine the best available scientific evidence with experiences of parents to present the best possible resources for parents to gain further knowledge and involvement in the health of their children.</li>
<li><strong>Symptom Checker</strong> - The Symptom Checker is a tool that can be used to determine possible illnesses or conditions that a child may be experiencing depending on what part of the body is causing conflict for the child from their visible symptoms.</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/first-aid-by-american-red-cross/id529160691">First Aid: American Red Cross</a><ul>
<li>App administered by the American Red Cross that gives people access to expert resources and advice regarding everyday emergencies in various formats such as videos, interactive quizzes, and step-by-step guides.</li>
<li><strong>Language Toggle functionality</strong> - This functionality allows the user to switch between English and Spanish by simply pressing a toggle button. This is a feature that our client has requested for our project albeit with French instead of Spanish, so this feature can be drawn upon as inspiration to determine the best way to integrate the language toggle.</li>
<li><strong>9-1-1 Call Integration functionality</strong> - This feature allows the user to call 9-1-1 directly through the application which is also a feature that our client has requested be included in our project. Since we need this exact feature, the means in which the American Red Cross implemented this feature can be drawn upon for inspiration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kidsdoc-from-the-aap/id373964536">KidsDoc</a><ul>
<li>App administered by the American Academy of Pediatrics that helps parents determine the degree of care their children may require based on their symptoms.</li>
<li><strong>Symptom Checker functionality</strong> - Very similar functionality to what we are planning to implement with the Symptom Checker. Allows users to click on the body part of a child body model to see symptoms associated with that body part. This functionality will be partially used as inspiration as to the style in which we should implement the symptom checker into the application.</li>
<li><strong>‘Immediate Connections’ functionality</strong> - This is similar in premise to a client requested feature where the user is able to quickly access a phone call to 911 or call nearby Emergency Departments. This feature can be used as inspiration since the client’s requested feature follows the same general premise with a slight variation in the approach.</li>
<li><strong>‘Home Care Advice’ functionality</strong> - This is similar to the Knowledge Translation(KT) tools integrated into the client app where the parent is able to access clear and up-to-date information and resources for the parents to treat their children’s symptoms from home.</li>
