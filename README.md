# ARCHE | ECHO App

## Deployment Website
https://ualberta-cmput401.github.io/arche-echo/requirements/

## Project Overview

This project involves developing an app for parents managing their child's acute illness. The ARCHE and ECHO groups have been co-developing parental health resources (i.e. KT tools such as interactive infographics, videos, and eBooks). These resources are played in healthcare setting across Canada including Albertaâ€™s HUTV platform which results in exposure to almost a million viewers each month.

Our goal is to increase the accessibility and visibility of these tools to parents by housing them in a publicly available app. So far, we have been gathering and analyzing parents' preferences around health app content and features (e.g. a map of hospitals with ER wait times), and would like to translate this information into a working prototype.

The app will support two languages: English and French.
